Not much of a point to this post. The blog should soon speak for itself.

I plan on writing mostly about technical topics, but who knows? These things can change.

This blog is currently using the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) theme, although the
appearance may change slightly as I fine-tune.
